%h2#about About Us

%h3 Who We Are

%p Bike Walk Vote works to elect candidates who best support Oregonians who walk, bike, and take transit. We also work on ballot measures and important legislative issues.

%p Formed in 2004, we first worked in elections in 2004, 2006, and 2008. Our endorsed candidates and measures won 15 of 19 elections in those years.

%p After a hiatus in 2010, we relaunched Bike Walk Vote. Our first action was endorsing Alissa Keny-Guyer for appointment to the Oregon legislature, an appointment she won. We made ten endorsements for the 2012 elections and eight of those canidates went on to win.

%h3 Our Unique Value
%p As a political action committee, Bike Walk Vote goes where most non-profits cannot - directly into candidate elections. We endorse candidates and work to elect our strongest allies. While advocacy, organizing, education and lobbying are all valuable activities, the most influential action is electing the right people in the first place.

%h3 Steering Committee
%p Bike Walk Vote is run by a volunteer steering committee representing a cross-section of skills and interests in the biking, walking, and transit community.

%h3 The Questionnaire
%p We continually work to have our questionnaires inform candidates about the most current issues in the bike, walk, and transit communities. Each race may have a different questionnaire, which helps inform our endorsement decisions. We also sometimes supplement written questionnaires with in-person interviews.
%p Have a question you'd love to see answered?  <a href="mailto:team@bikewalkvote.org?subject='Suggested Question'">Email us</a> and let us know.

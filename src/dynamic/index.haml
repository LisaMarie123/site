%p
  <strong>Bike Walk Vote PAC</strong> is the political voice for Oregonians who bike, walk, or take transit. We work to elect candidates who will best support transportation choices and livable communities.

%h2 Vision
%p
  The future of transportation is active and public: costing less to create and care for, improving quality of life, reducing health related expenses, and positively benefiting local business.
%p
  We envision an urban form that enables stress free active travel through and between our communities. Where the transportation infrastructure is enjoyable to use, accessible to all ages and meets the needs of people from all walks of life.

%h2 Contribute
%p
  Elections require money to reach voters. We need your help to get our message out and to help elect the candidates who will best support transportation choices. <a href="/contribute.html">Click here to give</a>.
%p
  In Oregon, the first $50 per individual and $100 per couple is eligible for <a href="http://oregontaxcredit.com">Oregon’s political tax credit</a> – meaning each dollar you give comes back to you at tax time. Donations to Bike Walk Vote PAC qualify for this credit.
